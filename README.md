# GROUP 1 APP PROJECT
## PAIN REFERRER
### Allows a quick look-up of potentially related diseases and illnesses associated with a subject's reported acute pain.

NOTE: This is not a replacement for health professional diagnoses nor emergency services, but, instead, a first-potential source of information to continue their own research concerning and/or present to a practitioner.

The central enhancement is a built-in, locally hosted, large dataset parser that allows better ease of updating information without touching hardcode every time a symptom weight is updated. This allows for scaling into cloud dataset updates and a focus on function and user experience (UX).

Given the short timeframe allotted and the sheer scope of the requirements, we will aim to exhibit, first and foremost, a working understanding of software development life cycles (SDLC) — specifically, Scrum via Jira and GitHub collaboration.
